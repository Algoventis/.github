# 🇨🇭 Algoventis Engineering Labs

We are a Swiss-based engineering studio focused on **AI Integration** and **DevOps Infrastructure**. 

Our mission is to bridge the gap between "Demo AI" and **Production Infrastructure**. We build tools that are privacy-first, self-hosted, and designed for environments where data egress is not an option.

### 🔭 Current Focus
* **Local LLM Infrastructure:** Running inference on standard K8s nodes (CPU/GPU).
* **Observability:** Enhancing the LGTM stack (Loki, Grafana) with semantic intelligence.
* **MCP Servers:** Building standard interfaces for AI agents to talk to infrastructure.

### 🏗️ Featured Projects
* **[LogDistill](https://github.com/algoventis/logdistill)** – The local AI engine for Loki. Summarize 10,000 logs into 5 insights without sending data to the cloud.
* *More internal tools are being open-sourced soon.*
